## INTRODUCTION

In HANGMAN the player's objective is to guess the hidden word. The player has 10 lives to guess the word. If the player guesses a letter present in the word the letter will appear in the word section and they will move on to their next guess. If the player guesses a letter that is not present in the word they will lose one life and the Hangman starts to be built. Each incorrect letter brings the hangman closer to being built. If all the lives are spent before the word is guessed, the hangman is fully built and the player loses the game. If the player guesses the word before the lives are spent they win the game.

## USER EXPERIENCE UX
### USER STORIES

As a general user, I want to:
1. Easily navigate through the game
2. Be able to understand the rules of the game.
3. See the correctness of the validation of my input values.
4. Be able to see what letters I have already selected.
5. Be able to see how many lives I have left


During the design, tests were carried out to try out visuals and initial features before establishing the final project repository.
## SCOPE
The project scope follows the minimal viable features approach for the initial project. However the scope is such that interactive features to enhance the user experience will be added in the future.
For the implementation of the ATM banking system I have planned the following features:
- Data from spreadsheet that contains the user's account and transactions to be displayed to the user in tables.
- Account creation starts from the beginning of the program if the user has no account.
- User account will be validated, if correct an option screen will be displayed to the user otherwise user will be referred back to create an account.
- The deposit option enables the user to add money to his/her account on passing the validation of the input data. The value of the amount, status, and date time is inserted into the transaction spreadsheet table.
- The withdraw option like the deposit option enables the user to remove money from his/her account if the amount input is valid. The amount requested by the user, status, and date time are inserted into the transactions spreadsheet table.
- The program displays warnings in all stages if input values are not given in the correct format.
- On-demand, a transaction table is displayed to the account holder if any, showing all his/her transactions with date time, amount, and status with reasons if the status is a failure.

## STRUCTURE
The user experience design is explicit, with features positioned conventionally. Navigation starts from the welcome message and intuitively exits the user if he wishes to.


### FLOWCHART
The Flowchart for my program was created using [LucidChart](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/0ea6b3ea-15d2-4224-8d87-f4cb79c1e504/edit?view_items=~A_qna7e~gO6%2CiA_qin-594Lj%2C-GCynUns-Lhk%2CWBCyDKANY6n8%2CtC_q.ugc0ykY%2C_GCyBuRiyuT8%2CUGaBpbitNrDr%2CNB_qjtwegra6%2CyN_qZtRYAS.k%2CQN_qc7A-Pjza%2C6ACyekr7hI1x%2CBO_qRQaICLUb%2CzO_qtwRH1phF%2CKO_q84z1~jpx%2CuxCyBT4_5jLN%2CRFCyzRnMuJP-%2CUO_q5KIubTSn%2CMO_qeyLKl4_R%2C2S_qwij~7oDz%2CFR_qFxsGLjv_%2C5R_q6sAcUmY5%2CMS_q.m.BR.cC%2C~S_qmapQ8_ev%2CrQ_qbucEDzrK%2CJECy.U-fqIgL%2CWACyobxv.xXf%2CVR_qYUxERad.&invitationId=inv_7aa4366a-6d4a-4551-b117-b9f5e4cd5eb2) and it visually represents how the system works.

## FEATURES
### EXISTING FEATURES
The program has a feature that will ease the work of bank workers by not taking the pains of registering every customer. Also, remove the hassle of customers creating accounts in banks.
For simulating a real-life experience, the system is linked to a <b>Google Spreedsheet</b> that can be accessed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19-2VbDweehojeCg4YcLQOBKUNskHD-2ef7-phK18IgQ/edit?usp=sharing).

- When the user launches the programm a welcome image is displayed with a question, if the user has an account or not.

![alt-text](assets/images/readme/start.png)
- Any input error by the user is caught and the corresponding message is displayed.

![alt-text](assets/images/readme/start_err.png)

- A no answer from the user will prompt the user to create an account.

![alt-text](assets/images/readme/account.png)

![alt-text](assets/images/readme/create_err1.png)
- A yes answer implies the user has an account and the programm will prompt the user for validation of his/credentials thrice.
If the user is unable to give correct credentials the programm returns back to start welcome question state.

![alt-text](assets/images/readme/acc_valid_err.png)

- If a user successfully logs in to the system, the option menu is displayed to the user.

![alt-text](assets/images/readme/options.png)

- If the user chooses option 3, his/her account details are displayed in a table for the user.

![alt-text](assets/images/readme/account_details.png)

- If the user chooses option 4, his/her transactions are shown on a table with the date time the transactions where made and there status.

![alt-text](assets/images/readme/transaction.png)

- If the user chooses option 1, he/she will be promted to enter the amount in figures to deposit. The transaction will be inserted to the transaction table.

![alt-text](assets/images/readme/depo_er.png)

- If the user chooses option 2, he/she will be prompted to enter the amount in figures, all errors are caught by the programm and the transaction is inserted into the transaction table.

![alt-text](assets/images/readme/withd_er.png)

- If there is an input error from the user, the programm also checks the balance of the user if there are sufficient funds and if everything is ok the user is then allowed to withdraw funds consequently with a success message.

![alt-text](assets/images/readme/transheet.png)


### FUTURE FEATURES
- Implement a more modern and secure way to save user's credentials
- Enable user's to do payment of utilities(water,gas, internet, telephone, etc)
- Implement an email message sent to customers about their current account weekly.

### LANGUAGES USED
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)

### TECHNOLOGIES USED
Git was used for version control.

[Gitpod](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/python-essentials-template) was used as the IDE

[Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/landing?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=_chart_en_tier1_mixed_search_brand_exact_&km_CPC_CampaignId=1490375427&km_CPC_AdGroupID=55688909257&km_CPC_Keyword=lucidchart&km_CPC_MatchType=e&km_CPC_ExtensionID=&km_CPC_Network=g&km_CPC_AdPosition=&km_CPC_Creative=442433236001&km_CPC_TargetID=aud-809923745462:kwd-33511936169&km_CPC_Country=20483&km_CPC_Device=c&km_CPC_placement=&km_CPC_target=&gclid=CjwKCAiA2rOeBhAsEiwA2Pl7Q5KsmhzrrvhWJy2CYebbpJzHxt99Tj-XuCHr2wL0hH5yf4c1nGYkMhoCLYgQAvD_BwE) was used for the flowchart.

[pep8](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) was used to validate the python code.

[Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/) was used to deploy the project.

### BUGS OR ERRORS
The following bug was found and squashed:

During the development process, the desire to give a good user experience was placed as the priority as a result, the code to achieve that aim was refactored several times. Finally, this was achieved, by introducing the function (do_options) and validating each user input in the (create_user) function.


### UNFIXED BUGS
There are no known outstanding bugs.


### TESTING

All the python files where tested in  [pep8](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/)


### MANUAL TESTING
Various users tested the atm application. Feedback was overall positive from all users.

The following functioned as intended:

- Account creation of user works correctly and inserts user credentials to google spreadsheet.
- Validation of user if prompted for credentials
- Shows a menu of options to a logged-in user
- The deposit function gives corresponding feedback depending on the user's input.
- Like the deposit function, the withdraw function also gives the corresponding feedback to the user depending on the input.
- On-demand users logged in can get details of their account or their transaction in a table.


The following were also tested and function correctly:
- Every input of users is validated, and the corresponding error/success message is displayed.
- The google spreadsheet is updated on every successful creation of an account.
- On every deposit or withdraw function call, the google spreadsheet is updated.
- The purpose of the application can be seen as the ease to create a user account.

# **Hangman**

In HANGMAN the player's objective is to guess the hidden word. The player has 10 lives to guess the word. If the player guesses a letter present in the word the letter will appear in the word section and they will move on to their next guess. If the player guesses a letter that is not present in the word they will lose one life and the Hangman starts to be built. Each incorrect letter brings the hangman closer to being built. If all the lives are spent before the word is guessed, the hangman is fully built and the player loses the game. If the player guesses the word before the lives are spent they win the game.

## User experience

### Project Goals

- The goal is to provide the user with a game that is fun as well as challenging. The user has to have a realistic opportunity to guess the word while also being reminded of the fact they have limited lives.

### User Stories

As a user, I want to:
- Be able to easily navigate through the game
- Be able to understand the rules of the game.
- Be able to see what letters I have already selected.
- Be told when I have input the same letter a second time.
- Be told when I have input an invalid character.
- Be able to see how many lives I have left
- Be told what the word is if I can't guess it.


### Colors

- The game features a colored header in the introduction as well as colored dividers after each input.When a Y/N input is required, Y/N is in green so the user will be more likely to realise those are their optiohns. When an invalid input has been entered the error handling is returned in red to draw the user's attention to the fact they have made an error.The countdown of the lives is colored differently. Lives 10-8 are green to show the user has plenty of lives left. Lives 7-4 is yellow to show the user is starting to run low. Lives 3-0 is red to imply urgency and that the user has to be careful how they choose their letters as they are about to die.

| In the levels() function user had to confirm his choice twice before he was able to continue with the game                  | Created global variable 'lives', which were later on called for the user tries instead levels() function                                                                                                   |
| After finishing thegame once user was only able to choose a difficulty level before the terminal was cut out                            | called game() function bellow levels() function in end_game() function                                                                                                    |
| Print statements from different screens were pilling up on top of each other, with user inputs and progress of the game                          | Imported os and created function which was used across the game to clear the terminal screen                                 |
| Too long lines during code                   | Run and formatted code through black.vercel.app                              |
| Game worked locally but not on Heroku app                   |  Created new excell sheet with new credentials and repeated process of connecting APIs, googleshet, heroku                           |
                                                                                                         
 ### Manual Testing
  #### Welcome screen

<details><summary>Screenshots</summary>
<img src="assets/readme_img/input_name_invalid.png">
</details>

  - I've tested that the input field for name takes only alphabet letters and nothing else and that error message is displayed to the user that warns the user of his input

 #### Decide to check the rules screen 

<details><summary>Screenshots</summary>
<img src="assets/readme_img/2nd_ivalid.png">
</details>

   - I've tested that the user is allowed to enter only letters that are displayed on the screen and that the error message is shown to the user and that those options lead the user to the screen that he chose to go to

 #### Rules screen

<details><summary>Screenshots</summary>
<img src="assets/readme_img/rules_invalid.png">
</details>

  - I've tested that user can only input the letter "P" which will take a user to the next screen, the wrong input is displayed to the user

 #### Game screen

</details>

  - I've tested multiple inputs on this screen
  - If a user repeats the letter that he already guessed error message will be displayed to the user
  - If a user inputs the number or any other special character error message will be displayed to the user
  - If a user inputs is wrong error message will notify the user 

#### End game screen

<details><summary>Screenshots</summary>

  - I've tested that the user is only allowed to input letters that are instructed on the screen and that with wrong input error message displays to user 

 #### Score screen

<details><summary>Screenshots</summary>
<img src="assets/readme_img/leader_invalid.png">
</details>

   - I've tested that user is only allowed to press letter "B" to go back to previous screen and that error message is displayed to the user if he puts wrong input

 #### Hangman game

  - I've tested that all instructions are displayed to the user and that all inputs that the user has to type will bring user to desired and expected outcome like it's displayed on the screens across the game
   - I've tested that score on the game page is with the rules of the game and that the overall score is uploaded to the google sheet and that data is printed out on the final screen if a user wishes to check the leaderboard
  - Also tested that data is presented to the user from top (best score) to the bottom

## Future Features
   - Features that I would like to add to the game would be, different categories that users can pick to guess the secret word
   - Use API services to randomly get words rather than storing them in folders
   - The user to be able to use a hint if he gets stuck
  
## Deployment
### Gitpod and git
 -  I created a repository in Github, named it Portafolio-3, and used the template Code-Institute-org/python-essentials-template
 -  Once the repository is created, click the green button to the right (Gitpod) to open Gitpod
 -  In the terminal, I've used the python3 run.py file provided by the template
 - At regular appropriate intervals the latest version of the code was saved via the git add and git commit commands. Appropriate commit messages were added to control the revisions.
- The git push command was used to push all committed code and documentation to the repository for secure storage.
 

### Heroku
This project was deployed using Code Institutes mock terminal for Heroku.

-  Log in to Heroku and click "New" and "Create new app"
-  Name the new app and click "Create new app".
-  In "Settings" select "BuildPack" and select Python and Node.js. (Python must be at the top of the list).
-  While still in "Settings", click "Reveal Config Vars" and add the following; KEY: PORT, VALUE: 8000. and
content from creds.json file
-  Click on "Deploy" and select your deploy method and search for the repository name.
-  Click "Connect" on a selected repository.
-  Either choose "Enable Automatic Deploys" or "Deploy Branch" in the manual deploy section.
-  Heroku will now deploy the app.
