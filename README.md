# **Hangman**

In HANGMAN the player's objective is to guess the hidden word. The player has 10 lives to guess the word. If the player guesses a letter present in the word the letter will appear in the word section and they will move on to their next guess. If the player guesses a letter that is not present in the word they will lose one life and the Hangman starts to be built. Each incorrect letter brings the hangman closer to being built. If all the lives are spent before the word is guessed, the hangman is fully built and the player loses the game. If the player guesses the word before the lives are spent they win the game.

## User experience

### Project Goals

- The goal is to provide the user with a game that is fun as well as challenging. The user has to have a realistic opportunity to guess the word while also being reminded of the fact they have limited lives.

### User Stories

As a user, I want to:
- Be able to easily navigate through the game
- Be able to understand the rules of the game.
- Be able to see what letters I have already selected.
- Be told when I have input the same letter a second time.
- Be told when I have input an invalid character.
- Be able to see how many lives I have left
- Be told what the word is if I can't guess it.


### Colors

- The game features a colored header in the introduction as well as colored dividers after each input.When a Y/N input is required, Y/N is in green so the user will be more likely to realise those are their optiohns. When an invalid input has been entered the error handling is returned in red to draw the user's attention to the fact they have made an error.The countdown of the lives is colored differently. Lives 10-8 are green to show the user has plenty of lives left. Lives 7-4 is yellow to show the user is starting to run low. Lives 3-0 is red to imply urgency and that the user has to be careful how they choose their letters as they are about to die.

### Technology Used

- #### Languages:

   - Python

- #### Libraries
  * [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
    * Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and push to GitHub
  * [GitHub](https://github.com/)
    * GitHub is used to store the project's code after being pushed from Git
  * [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com)
    * Heroku was used to deploy the live project
  * [Lucidchart](https://lucid.app/)
    * Lucidchart was used to creating the flowchart
  * [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/)
    * The PEP8 was used to validate all the Python code
  * [Patorjk](https://patorjk.com)
    * Patorjk (ASCII Art Generator) was used to create a banner across the game

- If the user managed to guess all the letters in the word before their lives ran out they are presented with a message of congratulations and are also let know how many lives they had left. If the user doesn't guess the word before their lives run out they will be presented with a message comiserating with them while also noting the full word. The hangman will also be fully completed.

| Couldn't get spaces between the underscores used for the unguessed letters of the word.| Redid the code to have no spaces between them.|
| Visual representation was confusing.  | Introduced colorama and add spacing to the print statements across the game       |
| Lines that were too long put through validator.                   | Run and formatted code through CI Python Linter                     |
| Game wouldn't work as colorama module wasn't found even though it had been installed                 |   Re- installed the colorama package using a different version of Pythog in case my IDE might have been set up to use a different version.

  - I tested the end of game page to make sure the only inputs accepted at "Y" or "N". If anything else for example, a number, a special symbol or a space is entered a warning message is produced.

## Future Features
   - I would like to have levels of difficulty, the more difficult the level the fewer lives the user has.
   - I would like to have a hint feature that allows the user to ask for a hint in exchange for a life.

## Credits

I have consulted numerous websites, individuals and slack channels to get support for the code. No code block is directly copied but some generates from information I gathered from other developers and sites:

 - [Kite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4nEnsavl6w&ab_channel=Kite) ffor swapping out the underscore for the correctly guessed letter in the word.
 - [Patorjik](https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=ANSI%20Shadow&t=HANGMAN) for the ASCII header at the beginning of the programme.
 - [Borislav Hadzhiev](https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/python-no-module-named-colorama) for checking to make sure i was using the correct version of Python in order to get colorama to work.
 - [NPStation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtYw0RaZ4B0&ab_channel=NPStation) for their helpful pyton hangman tutorial video.
 - [Codereview](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/101968/hangman-with-ascii) for its hangman art.


- Acknowledgment
  - Thank you to my mentor Lauren-Nicole who gave me great advice and feedback on how to plan and execute this project and who provided me with lots of pointers on resources to help with coding and testing.
  - I would also like to thank our class facilitator Marko from Code Institute for giving advice on this project.
